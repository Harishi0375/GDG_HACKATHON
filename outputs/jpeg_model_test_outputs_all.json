The \"Learning probabilities\" section introduces the idea of estimating probabilities *p* using a prediction function *b(xi)*. It then analyzes the case where all training objects are identical, showing a derivation for minimizing a loss function. An example using \"quadratic loss\" is worked through, demonstrating that minimizing the expected loss results in the optimal prediction *b_opt* being equal to the true probability *p*.",
        "3.jpeg": "The image contains handwritten notes on grid paper about \"Maximum likelihood for Bernoulli distribution\". The notes cover the probabilistic model, the likelihood function, the negative log-likelihood (related to minimizing a function `F(w)`), and the definition of \"logistic loss (log loss)\". A section titled \"Learning probabilities with logistic loss\" follows, explaining a \"Desired property\" that minimizing the expected logistic loss yields the true probability, and includes a mathematical derivation to prove this. The final \"Result\" states that logistic loss correctly estimates probabilities.",
        "4.jpeg": "The image contains handwritten notes discussing an optimization problem. Mathematical expressions involving sums, vectors ($a_i$), matrices ($X$, $A$), trace, determinant, and derivatives are present, along with definitions of variables ($a_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ being a positively definite matrix). The objective function is minimized. Steps to find the optimal solution $X^*$ are shown, involving derivatives and setting the gradient to zero. A key identity $d(\\log \\det(x)) = x^{-1}$ is highlighted. The final line states that the optimal choice of $X$ is simply the sum of the outer products of vectors $a_i$ and $dx$.",
