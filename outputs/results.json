These methods aim to address the challenges of fine-tuning large language models by training only a small subset of parameters. We provide a taxonomy that covers a broad range of methods and present a detailed method comparison with a specific focus on real-life efficiency in fine-tuning multibillion-scale language models. We also conduct an extensive head-to-head experimental comparison of 15 diverse PEFT methods, evaluating their performance and efficiency on models up to 11B parameters. Our findings reveal that methods previously shown to surpass a strong LoRA baseline face difficulties in resource-constrained settings, where hyperparameter optimization is limited and the network is fine-tuned only for a few epochs. Finally, we provide a set of practical recommendations for using PEFT methods and outline potential future research directions.\n    * Location: Below the author information\n    * Confidence: High\n* Keywords: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Large Language Models\n    * Location: Below the abstract\n    * Confidence: High\n* 1 Introduction\n    * Location: Left side of the page, section heading\n    * Confidence: High\n* In October 2018, BERT Large (Devlin et al., 2019) with 350 million parameters was the biggest Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) ever trained.\n    * Location: Paragraph 1, Introduction\n    * Confidence: High\n* At the time, contemporary hardware struggled to fine-tune this model.\n    * Location: Paragraph 1, Introduction\n    * Confidence: High\n* The section \"Out-of-memory issues\" on BERT's GitHub¹ specifies the maximum batch size for BERT Large given 12GB of GPU RAM and 512 tokens as zero.\n    * Location: Paragraph 1, Introduction\n    * Confidence: High\n* Five years in, publicly available models grew to 176 billion parameters (Scao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022), i.e. by a factor of 500.\n    * Location: Paragraph 1, Introduction\n    * Confidence: High\n* Published literature includes models up to 1 trillion parameters (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Shoeybi et al., 2019; Fedus et al., 2021).\n    * Location: Paragraph 1, Introduction\n    * Confidence: High\n* One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation...\n    * Location: Right side of the page, quote\n    * Confidence: High\n\n**Category:**\nResearch Paper\n"
